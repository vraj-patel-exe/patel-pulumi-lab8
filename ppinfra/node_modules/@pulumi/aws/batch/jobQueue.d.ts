/**
 * Provides a Batch Job Queue resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Job Queue
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testQueue = new aws.batch.JobQueue("test_queue", {
 *     name: "tf-test-batch-job-queue",
 *     state: "ENABLED",
 *     priority: 1,
 *     computeEnvironmentOrders: [
 *         {
 *             order: 1,
 *             computeEnvironment: testEnvironment1.arn,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             order: 2,
 *             computeEnvironment: testEnvironment2.arn,
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Job Queue with a fair share scheduling policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.batch.SchedulingPolicy("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     fairSharePolicy: {
 *         computeReservation: 1,
 *         shareDecaySeconds: 3600,
 *         shareDistributions: [{
 *             shareIdentifier: "A1*",
 *             weightFactor: 0.1,
 *         }],
 *     },
 * });
 * const exampleJobQueue = new aws.batch.JobQueue("example", {
 *     name: "tf-test-batch-job-queue",
 *     schedulingPolicyArn: example.arn,
 *     state: "ENABLED",
 *     priority: 1,
 *     computeEnvironmentOrders: [
 *         {
 *             order: 1,
 *             computeEnvironment: testEnvironment1.arn,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             order: 2,
 *             computeEnvironment: testEnvironment2.arn,
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Batch Job Queue using the `arn`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:batch/jobQueue:JobQueue test_queue arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789012:job-queue/sample
 * ```
