/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudformation.StackInstances("example", {
 *     accounts: [
 *         "123456789012",
 *         "234567890123",
 *     ],
 *     regions: [
 *         "us-east-1",
 *         "us-west-2",
 *     ],
 *     stackSetName: exampleAwsCloudformationStackSet.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example IAM Setup in Target Account
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         principals: [{
 *             identifiers: [aWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.arn],
 *             type: "AWS",
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole = new aws.iam.Role("AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole", {
 *     assumeRolePolicy: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy.then(aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy => aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy.json),
 *     name: "AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
 * });
 * // Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html
 * // Additional IAM permissions necessary depend on the resources defined in the StackSet template
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicy = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: [
 *             "cloudformation:*",
 *             "s3:*",
 *             "sns:*",
 *         ],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         resources: ["*"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyRolePolicy = new aws.iam.RolePolicy("AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole_MinimumExecutionPolicy", {
 *     name: "MinimumExecutionPolicy",
 *     policy: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicy.then(aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicy => aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicy.json),
 *     role: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example Deployment across Organizations account
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudformation.StackInstances("example", {
 *     deploymentTargets: {
 *         organizationalUnitIds: [exampleAwsOrganizationsOrganization.roots[0].id],
 *     },
 *     regions: [
 *         "us-west-2",
 *         "us-east-1",
 *     ],
 *     stackSetName: exampleAwsCloudformationStackSet.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Import CloudFormation stack instances that target OUs, using the stack set name, `call_as`, and "OU" separated by commas (`,`). For example:
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import CloudFormation stack instances using the stack set name and `call_as` separated by commas (`,`). If you are importing a stack instance targeting OUs, see the example below. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:cloudformation/stackInstances:StackInstances example example,SELF
 * ```
 * Using `pulumi import`, Import CloudFormation stack instances that target OUs, using the stack set name, `call_as`, and "OU" separated by commas (`,`). For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:cloudformation/stackInstances:StackInstances example example,SELF,OU
 * ```
