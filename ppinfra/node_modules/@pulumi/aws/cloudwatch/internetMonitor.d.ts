 * Provides a Internet Monitor Monitor resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudwatch.InternetMonitor("example", {monitorName: "exmple"});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Internet Monitor Monitors using the `monitor_name`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:cloudwatch/internetMonitor:InternetMonitor some some-monitor
 * ```
