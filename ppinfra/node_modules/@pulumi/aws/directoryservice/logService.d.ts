/**
 * Provides a Log subscription for AWS Directory Service that pushes logs to cloudwatch.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudwatch.LogGroup("example", {
 *     name: `/aws/directoryservice/${exampleAwsDirectoryServiceDirectory.id}`,
 *     retentionInDays: 14,
 * });
 * const ad_log_policy = aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: [
 *             "logs:CreateLogStream",
 *             "logs:PutLogEvents",
 *         ],
 *         principals: [{
 *             identifiers: ["ds.amazonaws.com"],
 *             type: "Service",
 *         }],
 *         resources: [pulumi.interpolate`${example.arn}:*`],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const ad_log_policyLogResourcePolicy = new aws.cloudwatch.LogResourcePolicy("ad-log-policy", {
 *     policyDocument: ad_log_policy.apply(ad_log_policy => ad_log_policy.json),
 *     policyName: "ad-log-policy",
 * });
 * const exampleLogService = new aws.directoryservice.LogService("example", {
 *     directoryId: exampleAwsDirectoryServiceDirectory.id,
 *     logGroupName: example.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Directory Service Log Subscriptions using the directory id. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:directoryservice/logService:LogService msad d-1234567890
 * ```
