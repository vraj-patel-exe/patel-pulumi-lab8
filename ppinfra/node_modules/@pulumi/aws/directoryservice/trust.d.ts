import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a trust relationship between two Active Directory Directories.
 *
 * The directories may either be both AWS Managed Microsoft AD domains or an AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain and a self-managed Active Directory Domain.
 *
 * The Trust relationship must be configured on both sides of the relationship.
 * If a Trust has only been created on one side, it will be in the state `VerifyFailed`.
 * Once the second Trust is created, the first will update to the correct state.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Two-Way Trust
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const oneDirectory = new aws.directoryservice.Directory("one", {
 *     name: "one.example.com",
 *     type: "MicrosoftAD",
 * });
 * const twoDirectory = new aws.directoryservice.Directory("two", {
 *     name: "two.example.com",
 *     type: "MicrosoftAD",
 * });
 * const one = new aws.directoryservice.Trust("one", {
 *     directoryId: oneDirectory.id,
 *     remoteDomainName: twoDirectory.name,
 *     trustDirection: "Two-Way",
 *     trustPassword: "Some0therPassword",
 *     conditionalForwarderIpAddrs: twoDirectory.dnsIpAddresses,
 * });
 * const two = new aws.directoryservice.Trust("two", {
 *     directoryId: twoDirectory.id,
 *     remoteDomainName: oneDirectory.name,
 *     trustDirection: "Two-Way",
 *     trustPassword: "Some0therPassword",
 *     conditionalForwarderIpAddrs: oneDirectory.dnsIpAddresses,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### One-Way Trust
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const oneDirectory = new aws.directoryservice.Directory("one", {
 *     name: "one.example.com",
 *     type: "MicrosoftAD",
 * });
 * const twoDirectory = new aws.directoryservice.Directory("two", {
 *     name: "two.example.com",
 *     type: "MicrosoftAD",
 * });
 * const one = new aws.directoryservice.Trust("one", {
 *     directoryId: oneDirectory.id,
 *     remoteDomainName: twoDirectory.name,
 *     trustDirection: "One-Way: Incoming",
 *     trustPassword: "Some0therPassword",
 *     conditionalForwarderIpAddrs: twoDirectory.dnsIpAddresses,
 * });
 * const two = new aws.directoryservice.Trust("two", {
 *     directoryId: twoDirectory.id,
 *     remoteDomainName: oneDirectory.name,
 *     trustDirection: "One-Way: Outgoing",
 *     trustPassword: "Some0therPassword",
 *     conditionalForwarderIpAddrs: oneDirectory.dnsIpAddresses,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import the Trust relationship using the directory ID and remote domain name, separated by a `/`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:directoryservice/trust:Trust example d-926724cf57/directory.example.com
 * ```
