import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides an Elastic IP resource.
 *
 * > **Note:** EIP may require IGW to exist prior to association. Use `dependsOn` to set an explicit dependency on the IGW.
 *
 * > **Note:** Do not use `networkInterface` to associate the EIP to `aws.lb.LoadBalancer` or `aws.ec2.NatGateway` resources. Instead use the `allocationId` available in those resources to allow AWS to manage the association, otherwise you will see `AuthFailure` errors.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Single EIP associated with an instance
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const lb = new aws.ec2.Eip("lb", {
 *     instance: web.id,
 *     domain: "vpc",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Multiple EIPs associated with a single network interface
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const multi_ip = new aws.ec2.NetworkInterface("multi-ip", {
 *     subnetId: main.id,
 *     privateIps: [
 *         "10.0.0.10",
 *         "10.0.0.11",
 *     ],
 * });
 * const one = new aws.ec2.Eip("one", {
 *     domain: "vpc",
 *     networkInterface: multi_ip.id,
 *     associateWithPrivateIp: "10.0.0.10",
 * });
 * const two = new aws.ec2.Eip("two", {
 *     domain: "vpc",
 *     networkInterface: multi_ip.id,
 *     associateWithPrivateIp: "10.0.0.11",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Attaching an EIP to an Instance with a pre-assigned private ip (VPC Only)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const _default = new aws.ec2.Vpc("default", {
 *     cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
 *     enableDnsHostnames: true,
 * });
 * const gw = new aws.ec2.InternetGateway("gw", {vpcId: _default.id});
 * const myTestSubnet = new aws.ec2.Subnet("my_test_subnet", {
 *     vpcId: _default.id,
 *     cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/24",
 *     mapPublicIpOnLaunch: true,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [gw],
 * });
 * const foo = new aws.ec2.Instance("foo", {
 *     ami: "ami-5189a661",
 *     instanceType: aws.ec2.InstanceType.T2_Micro,
 *     privateIp: "10.0.0.12",
 *     subnetId: myTestSubnet.id,
 * });
 * const bar = new aws.ec2.Eip("bar", {
 *     domain: "vpc",
 *     instance: foo.id,
 *     associateWithPrivateIp: "10.0.0.12",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [gw],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Allocating EIP from the BYOIP pool
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const byoip_ip = new aws.ec2.Eip("byoip-ip", {
 *     domain: "vpc",
 *     publicIpv4Pool: "ipv4pool-ec2-012345",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Allocating EIP from the IPAM Pool
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const ipam_ip = new aws.ec2.Eip("ipam-ip", {
 *     domain: "vpc",
 *     ipamPoolId: "ipam-pool-07ccc86aa41bef7ce",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import EIPs in a VPC using their Allocation ID. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:ec2/eip:Eip bar eipalloc-00a10e96
 * ```
