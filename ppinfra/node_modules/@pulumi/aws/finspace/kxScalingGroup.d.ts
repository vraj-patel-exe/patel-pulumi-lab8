/**
 * Resource for managing an AWS FinSpace Kx Scaling Group.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.finspace.KxScalingGroup("example", {
 *     name: "my-tf-kx-scalinggroup",
 *     environmentId: exampleAwsFinspaceKxEnvironment.id,
 *     availabilityZoneId: "use1-az2",
 *     hostType: "kx.sg.4xlarge",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import an AWS FinSpace Kx Scaling Group using the `id` (environment ID and scaling group name, comma-delimited). For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:finspace/kxScalingGroup:KxScalingGroup example n3ceo7wqxoxcti5tujqwzs,my-tf-kx-scalinggroup
 * ```
