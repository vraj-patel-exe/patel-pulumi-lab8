/**
 * Retrieve information about a firewall policy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Find firewall policy by name
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.networkfirewall.getFirewallPolicy({
 *     name: firewallPolicyName,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Find firewall policy by ARN
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.networkfirewall.getFirewallPolicy({
 *     arn: firewallPolicyArn,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Find firewall policy by name and ARN
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.networkfirewall.getFirewallPolicy({
 *     arn: firewallPolicyArn,
 *     name: firewallPolicyName,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * AWS Network Firewall does not allow multiple firewall policies with the same name to be created in an account. It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.
 *
 * > **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.
