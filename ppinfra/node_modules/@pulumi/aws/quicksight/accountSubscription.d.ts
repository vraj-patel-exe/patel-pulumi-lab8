 * Resource for managing an AWS QuickSight Account Subscription.
 *
 * > Due to the absence of the `adminGroup`, `authorGroup`, and `readerGroup` fields in the [`DescribeAccountSettings`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountSettings.html) API response, changes made to these groups post-subscription will not be detected by this resource.
